## Stakeholders

Our Target End-Users are college students.

NYU Senior 1: The most important aspect of a study/class management app for them is for it to offer an easy way to visualize their schedule (including classes, assignments, exams, etc.) all in one place. They wished Brightspace was easier to use on the go and liked that it reminded you about assignments, but wished it offered a calendar view for them. They believe Brightspace is missing a place/way to easily connect with classmates and/or TAs to ask questions or discuss things went over in class. Finally, they would like if enrolling for courses was in the same app as where you view your classes and assignments, not in a separate app.

## Product Vision Statement

Our product is a general centralized study and class management app meant to make it simple for students to go about their daily needs, offering an alternative to platforms such as Brightspace, Moodle, etc.

## User Requirements

1. As a student, I want to view my class times, assignments, and club events/activities all in one calendar view automatically as they are assigned so that I can stay organized with all my deadlines.
2. As a student, I want to access additional tutoring resources so that I can get help with difficult class topics.
3. As a student, I want to see in an organized manner the readings I have for a particular lecture, alongside the scheduled topics and homework so that I can find all my readings easily.
4. As a student, I want to access a lecture’s assigned readings/topics/homework on a calendar with the rest of my deadlines, so that I can easily switch between different classes during a study session and still see what I have to accomplish across classes by a particular date.
5. As a student, I want to discuss class topics with my peers and ask my professor/TAs questions so that I can get help with things I don’t understand.
6. As a student, I want to keep track of my homework/readings in a to-do list so that I know what has been done and still needs to be done.
7. As a student, I want to see the syllabi/schedule of any class at NYU (past and present) so that I can see if a class is one that I want to take now or in the future.
8. As a student, I want to access all of my grades and feedback in a centralized platform so I can easily keep track of my progress in all my classes.
9. As a student, I want to access all announcements from professors or clubs in an organized place so that I can stay on top of any changes and communications.
10. As a club leader, I want to have a central platform where I can manage meetings and post announcements for all to see.
