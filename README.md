## User Requirements

1. As a student, I want to view my class times, assignments, and club events/activities all in one calendar view automatically as they are assigned so that I can stay organized with all my deadlines.
2. As a student, I want to access additional tutoring resources so that I can get help with difficult class topics.
3. As a student, I want to see in an organized manner the readings I have for a particular lecture, alongside the scheduled topics and homework so that I can find all my readings easily.
4. As a student, I want to access a lecture’s assigned readings/topics/homework on a calendar with the rest of my deadlines, so that I can easily switch between different classes during a study session and still see what I have to accomplish across classes by a particular date.
5. As a student, I want to discuss class topics with my peers and ask my professor/TAs questions so that I can get help with things I don’t understand.
6. As a student, I want to keep track of my homework/readings in a to-do list so that I know what has been done and still needs to be done.
7. As a student, I want to see the syllabi/schedule of any class at NYU (past and present) so that I can see if a class is one that I want to take now or in the future.
